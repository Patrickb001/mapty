# Mapty Project

This project was built with the purpose of keeping a log of your exercises. When you open up the application it will ask for your permission to get your location (this process is needed in order to make the application work). After that you will be able to click an area on the map to track your workouts, you will be able to input your workout information into a form and store it there! The application currently cycles between running and cycling, enjoy!
